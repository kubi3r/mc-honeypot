# mc-honeypot

my first rust project, a honeypot that pretends to be a minecraft server

server list response is editable in `status_resp.json`

add the --webhook {URL} argument to send logs to a webhook

add the --server-icon {PATH} argument to use the server icon at the path

also it runs on a single thread so it kinda sucks
