# mc-honeypot

my first rust project, a honeypot that pretends to be a minecraft server and sends logs to a webhook

server list response is editable in `status_resp.json`

if the --server-icon {PATH} argument is specified, the icon at the path will be sent with the server list response

also it runs on a single thread so it kinda sucks
